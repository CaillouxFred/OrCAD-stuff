Some Files and Folders to better organise OrCAD libraries and content
This is a work in progress until I have completed the translation for all OrCAD Capture Libraries available on the installation folder on the C:\ drive.
Specifically in consist of a whole bunch of MS EXCEL files. Each of them has one worksheet containing all the parts available in one Library. 
The complete work should end up with 404 EXCEL files all written in the proper folder and subfolders just like the original OrCAD16 installation folder.
This will greatly facilitate the search for a part or partial part reference when the complete folder and subfolders are installed on your hard drive. 
When used in conjunction with Windows Explorer and the indexation capabilities of Windows, it will provide a quick and easy way to locate and or find out if one part is present in those OrCAD Libraries.
Usage: Copy the whole folder and files in your prefered location and use Windows Explorer to search for a part.
Windows Explorer will show you in which library it found the part. You can then open the EXCEL library to conform or
go strait to the OrCAD Capture Library to get the part itself in your schematic.
At present time the work is not finished. The main Capture\Library Folder is done. I have to complete all the subsequent subFolders. Which is a lot of work in itself. Be patient, the rest will come eventually.
Enjoy...
